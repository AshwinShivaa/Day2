The Document Object Model (DOM), which represents the structure of a web page. Here are the key differences between the Document and Window objects: 

Document Object:

Represents the structure and content of an HTML document.
Accessed through the document property of the Window object.
Primarily deals with elements within the HTML, allowing manipulation of content, structure, and handling of events within the document.
Examples of usage include selecting HTML elements, modifying their content, and responding to user interactions within the document.

Window Object:

Represents the browser window or tab.
Acts as the global object in client-side JavaScript.
Manages the browser environment and provides control over the window or tab.
Includes properties and methods for navigating, opening/closing windows, handling events related to the entire window, and controlling the browser environment.
The global window object is always available, and it may contain multiple documents or frames, each with its own Document object.

In essence, the Document object is about dealing with the content and structure of the HTML document, while the Window object is focused on managing the browser window and its overall environment. They work together in the Document Object Model (DOM) to enable dynamic and interactive web pages.
